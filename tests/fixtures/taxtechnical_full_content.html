            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>This revenue alert provides guidance on the tax treatment of employee allowances. It sets out the Commissioner's view on when allowances paid to employees are subject to income tax.</p>
            <p>Employers should be aware that not all allowances are exempt from tax. The taxability depends on the nature and purpose of the allowance.</p>

            <h2>Application</h2>
            <p>This alert applies to all employers who pay allowances to employees as part of their employment package. It covers the following types of allowances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Travel allowances</li>
                <li>Meal allowances</li>
                <li>Clothing allowances</li>
                <li>Tool allowances</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Detailed Analysis</h2>

            <h3>Travel Allowances</h3>
            <p>Travel allowances paid to employees for work-related travel may be exempt from tax under section CW 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007. To qualify for the exemption, the travel must be undertaken in the course of the employee's duties.</p>

            <h3>Meal Allowances</h3>
            <p>Meal allowances are generally taxable unless they meet specific conditions. The allowance must be paid for meals consumed while the employee is away from their normal place of work on employment duties.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Employers must carefully assess each allowance to determine its tax treatment. When in doubt, seek professional tax advice.</p>
